I was born and raised in [Luoyang](https://baike.baidu.com/item/%E6%B4%9B%E9%98%B3%E5%B8%82/6786279?fromtitle=%E6%B4%9B%E9%98%B3&fromid=125712&fr=aladdin). Luoyang is located in Henan province, China, and is known for its rich history, including being the ancient capital of multiple dynasties, and its cultural treasures such as the Longmen Grottoes and White Horse Temple. I'm looking forward to seeing you in my hometown.


Education
======
I am doing my Master's at [Huazhong University of Science and Technology (HUST)](https://www.hust.edu.cn/), and affiliated with Laboratory of Digital Media Processing and Retrieval ([DML](http://media.hust.edu.cn/)).  I received bachelor's degree in [Huazhong University of Science and Technology (HUST)](https://www.hust.edu.cn/) in 2021. Before that I studied at YanShi senior middle school HeNan province.

**I am preparing to apply for a PHD and looking for further studies starting from fall 2024.**

Research Interests
======
My research primarily revolves around the application of Deep Learning in Computer Vision, with a specific focus on the domains of robustness, weakly supervised and the utilization of diffusion models. Extensive investigations have been conducted to develop deep learning models that exhibit robustness and resilience in handling various challenges encountered in computer vision tasks, including occlusion, noise, and adversarial attacks. In the future, I am committed to improving visual content generation and open-world recognition algorithms, aiming to improve their robustness and enhance their ability to handle real-world data.

I am broadly interested in computer vision, visual synthesis, medical image analysis,and algorithm robustness.
